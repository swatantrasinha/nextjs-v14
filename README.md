1. Scenario: When image is loaded and parallel to it text is there on right side 
then it may happen that image loads slowly and hence text comes first on left side
and then when image is loaded text is shifted to right side. This will cause CLS issue.
To solve this see - docs folder : 01-Image_Size_Option.png
